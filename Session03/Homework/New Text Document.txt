1. Once a funtion defined, it can be use many times again. You can invoke your funtion many times in your program, 
which can save your work.
2. 	Step 1: Declare the function with the keyword def followed by the function name.
	Step 2: Write the arguments inside the opening and closing parentheses of the function, and end the 
declaration with a colon.
	Step 3: Add the program statements to be executed.
	Step 4: End the function with/without return statement.
3. Just write from file import function, and then call the function using function(a, b)
4. Return is a funtion. We use return to keep our output values, Python always wants to return something. So if the
programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value None.
5. I thinh we don't need to use return in every funtions.
6. Funtion Argument is a value rovided to a function when the function is called. This value is assigned
to the corresponding parameter in the function.
   The argument can be the result of an
expression which may involve operators, operands and calls to other fruitful functions.
   We call a funtion ex: funtion(a,b), a and b are funtion arguments
7.	Step 1: We must "call" this file: from (filename) import (funtion)
	Step 2: Then when we need to use it, just set a variable for it anh "call" it out
		Ex: i = funtion(a,b)
